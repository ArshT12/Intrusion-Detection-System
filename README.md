# Intrusion Detection Using Logistic Regression

This repository contains the implementation of a logistic regression model enhanced by regularization techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for intrusion detection in IoT environments. The project evaluates the effectiveness of different regularization methods (L1, L2, Elastic Net) and PCA on model performance using the RT-IoT2022 dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of logistic regression for intrusion detection, specifically focusing on the IoT context. By incorporating PCA and various regularization techniques, we aim to optimize model performance for accurately detecting potential security threats.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes encoding, scaling, and handling missing values.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of logistic regression with different regularization parameters.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Analysis of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score across various setups.

## Dataset

The RT-IoT2022 dataset used in this project is designed specifically for real-time intrusion detection tasks within IoT networks. The dataset comprises a broad spectrum of internet traffic samples, categorized into normal operations and various attack scenarios.
